﻿1
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:06,315
You cook for every girl you bring home?

2
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,068
Nah, just the ones that keep me alive.

3
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,574
You have a job or something to get to?

4
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:58,909
Or are you one of those
billionaire playboys

5
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,244
I'm always hearing about?

6
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,579
No, I have a job.

7
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,791
Damn, thought I'd lucked out.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,126
What do you do?

9
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,673
Lawyer. I have a practice, so...
my own boss.

10
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:15,426
Lawyer by day, vigilante by night.

11
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:17,553
The hell does that work?

12
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:20,597
Yeah, I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

13
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,395
Oh, shit.

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,239
You just opened
one of the cuts on your back.

15
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,609
How do you know that?

16
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,611
I can taste copper in the air.

17
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,950
"Copper in the air."

18
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,455
May I?

19
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,708
Knock yourself out, Houdini.

20
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,390
The swelling's down.

21
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:09,020
Rib fracture's only a hairline.
I couldn't tell before.

22
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:12,023
You have X-ray fingers now?

23
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,737
I can hear your bones shift
when you breathe.

24
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,822
No grinding means nothing's broken.

25
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,783
What does a hairline fracture sound like?

26
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:26,747
An old ship.

27
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,083
How do you...

28
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,461
I mean, I know that you're blind,

29
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:36,381
but you... see so much.

30
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,219
How?

31
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:45,974
I guess you have to think of it
as more than just five senses.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,647
I can't see, not like everyone else,
but I can feel.

33
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,066
Things like balance and direction.

34
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,404
Micro-changes in air density, vibrations,

35
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:02,448
blankets of temperature variations.

36
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:07,453
Mix all that with what I hear,
subtle smells.

37
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,207
All of the fragments form a sort of...

38
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,836
impressionistic painting.

39
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:19,424
Okay, but what does that look like?

40
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,719
Like, what do you...

41
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,806
actually see?

42
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:30,811
A world on fire.

43
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:45,116
If all I saw was fire,
I'd probably want to hit people, too.

44
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,621
I just wish I knew
I was hitting the right ones.

45
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,873
Claire...

46
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,377
they know who you are now.

47
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:57,879
And they're not going to stop.

48
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,800
I'd like you to stay here, with me...

49
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,178
just till I figure something out.

50
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,731
That's a hell of a way
to get a girl to move in.

51
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,605
It worked, didn't it?

52
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,234
Hmm.

53
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,773
I was wondering
if you were ever gonna do that.

54
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:01,526
Well, I've been a little busy.

55
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,782
I'll get you some clothes while I'm out.

56
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:07,949
Mmm.

57
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,207
Why don't you go to the police?

58
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,794
With all that you have on the Russians?

59
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,921
I wear a mask and beat on people.

60
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,840
Doesn't exactly mesh with police policy.

61
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,508
You're going to end up
in another dumpster,

62
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,094
you try to take down
the entire Russian mob yourself.

63
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,595
Maybe I only need to take down one man.

64
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,847
Fisk?

65
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,892
Cut off the head of the snake,
the body dies.

66
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:38,063
How do you know he's the head of the snake
if you can't find anything on him?

67
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:39,439
There was a murder in a bowling alley.

68
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:43,777
A man named Prohaszka.
Owned a majority in Kitchen Cabs.

69
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,071
They were turning those over
in the garage they took me to.

70
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:50,075
Right, I think Fisk hired the man
that killed Prohaszka.

71
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:51,785
Everything leads back to him...

72
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,871
but no one will talk.

73
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,290
Maybe you are beating
on the wrong people.

74
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:00,293
I heard a name, when they were...

75
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:05,548
The prick with the baseball bat
reacted when he heard it.

76
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,884
Like a dog when you yank his leash.

77
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:09,886
What was the name?

78
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,099
Vladimir.

79
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,019
It's me again. Call me back.

80
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,187
Shithead.

81
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,488
My employer sends his regards.

82
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:31,324
And his gratitude
that his offer was accepted.

83
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:35,912
There are still a few small details
we'd like to iron out before...

84
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,124
Uh, where's your brother?

85
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:41,752
This is a thing I was going to ask you.

86
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:45,881
Last time I saw him,
he was heading to see Mr....

87
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,217
Your employer.

88
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,012
He practically kissed me
when we agreed to terms.

89
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:55,891
He have a girl or... a boy
he might be celebrating with?

90
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,058
You try his cell?

91
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,269
- He does not answer.
- Try again.

92
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,856
We need to lock this down and get
distribution back to acceptable levels.

93
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,364
We found him.

94
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,084
Where?

95
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:24,848
He was dumped in the lot
around the corner.

96
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,640
My brother.

97
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,477
My brother.

98
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,359
We should have returned to Moscow.
Like you wanted...

99
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,645
The man in the mask.

100
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,021
He sends us a message.

101
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,673
Put every man we have on the street.

102
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,843
Find him.

103
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:17,806
And bring me his head.

105
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:38,344
Anyone else wondering about this?

106
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,279
Why aren't we meeting in the usual place?
And what's all this?

107
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,488
An opportunity...

108
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,409
for those willing to seize it.

109
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,627
She's happy to see you.

110
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:15,924
My apologies...

111
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,260
for my absence of late.

112
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:22,180
And for calling you here
on little notice.

113
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:25,558
Where are the Smiley Twins?
Sleeping off another kidnapping?

114
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,979
The Ranskahovs are no longer
a part of this organization.

115
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,063
Since when?

116
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:36,069
Since I removed Anatoly's head...
with my car door.

117
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:42,158
She's upset they weren't consulted.

118
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,079
He isn't happy either.

119
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,958
Deal me in on that.
What the hell happened?

120
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,215
It was a personal matter.

121
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,301
What? That's...

122
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,931
Vladimir isn't exactly
a hug-it-out kind of guy.

123
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:11,104
The masked vigilante killed his brother.
At least that's what Vladimir believes.

124
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,940
It will distract him
until preparations can be made.

125
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:20,488
We all knew that we would need to
eliminate the Russians one day.

126
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,034
They were too unpredictable.

127
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,495
This from a guy
taking heads off with a car door.

128
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,128
She wants to know
how her product is going to be moved now.

129
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,712
For the moment, you would...

130
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,090
keep sending your deliveries
to the Russians,

131
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,509
as though nothing has changed.

132
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:44,720
And when this is all over,
I'll assume their responsibility.

133
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,266
And move their share
to your column in the ledger?

134
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,480
A rising tide raises all boats, Leland.

135
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:57,442
Profits will be divided up
equally among us.

136
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:01,112
Four shares, instead of five.

137
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,171
Leland?

138
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,550
What, I'm going against the three of you?

139
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:25,136
I like my head where it's at.

140
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,889
Then we're in agreement.
Nothing changes...

141
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,809
until I'm ready to move on Vladimir.

142
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:35,438
And what if he finds out the truth
before that happens?

143
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:40,067
That would be unfortunate for all of us.

144
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,988
Masked vigilantes, crazy Russians...

145
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,824
I'm getting my stun gun out of storage.

146
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:52,830
Remember your promise to me...

147
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,957
and those I speak for.

148
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,882
Madame Gao...

149
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,219
may I walk you to your car?

150
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,270
She thinks you want something.

151
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,444
I want to put this behind us...

152
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,697
as quickly as possible.

153
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,090
Shut up.

154
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,428
Ask him about the man in the mask.

155
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,055
Hey.

156
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:53,474
Man in black mask... you know?

157
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,312
Any of you Gao's runners know anything?

158
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,148
I'm talking to you!

159
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:02,650
Hello?

160
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,531
Piotr, the guy's an idiot.

161
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,117
Let's go.

162
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,919
Wait.

163
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,623
Huh?

164
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,378
- Where's Vladimir?
- No, please!

165
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,588
Vladimir! Where is he?

166
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,090
Please, I'll tell you what you want!
Just don't cut my head off!

167
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,342
What are you talking about?

168
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,886
Vladimir's brother.
Everyone knows you took his head.

169
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:45,062
On the ground! On the ground!

170
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:56,866
Be advised two on foot.

171
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,409
One en route to the 15th.

172
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,580
No! Oh, my God.

173
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,040
You don't make any sense!

174
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,129
Whoa, be nice to it.

175
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:12,297
You know, for when the machines take over.

176
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:14,884
I can't get any of this crap
I bought to work.

177
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,469
Bad time to mention the phones?

178
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:18,929
All I hear when I try to dial
is a bunch of clicks.

179
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:22,307
Could be the machines plotting,
but I don't speak computer overlord.

180
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,309
- No, it's the rats.
- The who what now?

181
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:26,771
They chewed through the main line.

182
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:29,399
Phone guy's working on it now.
Exterminator's Monday.

183
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,734
We have rats now.
I'm never sleeping here again.

184
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,694
Then there's an upside.

185
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,923
Hey, you guys hear
anything on the news

186
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,365
about a Russian
getting his head cut off?

187
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:38,741
In Hell's Kitchen?

188
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,536
This city. Bad enough you get mugged,
now they chop your melon off.

189
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,079
What's next, groping corpses?

190
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,248
Excuse.

191
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,918
Is this, um...

192
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,337
Señor Foggy law?

193
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,466
Bess Mahoney? Brett's mom?

194
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,427
Sí, she refer me.

195
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:01,556
Something about cigars?

196
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:03,391
You know Spanish?

197
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,184
Oh, just what I remember from high school.

198
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,352
Mrs. Cardenas, tell us what happened.

199
00:18:09,063 --> 00:18:12,775
Mi casa es rent-control.

200
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,361
But the landlord, Señor Tully...

201
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:19,824
Armand Tully?
Sleaze bag owns buildings all over town.

202
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:22,326
Sí, y señor Tully...

203
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:31,586
He wants to convert
the apartments to condominiums.

204
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,338
And he wants them out.

205
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:39,552
Men came weeks ago.
They said that they were workers.

206
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:44,474
And they destroyed the apartments with a...
I don't know that last word.

207
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,766
Sledgehammers.

208
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:48,143
College.

209
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,355
You ever have a client that
wants to chat in Punjabi, I'm your man.

210
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,607
Um...

211
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,983
Do you want to do this?

212
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,985
No, no. I like listening to your voice.

213
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,948
Go on, Mrs. Cardenas.

214
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:04,326
There is damage, en todas partes.

215
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,786
Everywhere.

216
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:11,459
They have no working sinks or pipes.

217
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:14,545
They don't have water
or electricity for days.

218
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:17,757
We call policía. We speak to the officer.

219
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,012
- The police couldn't help.
- Policía say, "It is a city issue."

220
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:27,224
They don't know what to do.

221
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:29,977
This says Tully offered them 10,000

222
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,647
to give up their rent control
and vacate the premises.

223
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,566
Maybe we can pressure him
into giving a better payout.

224
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,777
No, Señor Foggy.

225
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,782
We do no want money.
We want to stay in our homes.

226
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,821
This way, Mrs. Cardenas.

227
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,514
I heard you say my name.
Why'd you say my name?

228
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:10,475
I told her you're going to
talk to Tully's lawyer.

229
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,103
Tully's lawyer?
Do you know who reps him?

230
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,230
Yeah, I know.

231
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,984
Landman and Zack!
Landman and mother-freakin' Zack, man!

232
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:22,237
Ooh, sounds impressive.
Are they looking to hire?

233
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,907
Oh, you wouldn't be happy.
We used to intern there.

234
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,283
Oh, right.

235
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:28,285
And they offered us a job, a great job.

236
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:32,247
Which we turned down to go off
and save the world. Now they hate us.

237
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,533
We'll need to load for bear
if we're gonna take them on.

238
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,836
I'll hit the precinct to
check for complaints against Tully.

239
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,671
I can't go to L and Z alone.

240
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:42,216
They're gonna shark attack me, Matt.
Look at me, I'm delicious.

241
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,676
Well, take Karen.

242
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,180
I mean, yeah, if she wants to.

243
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,514
Oh...

244
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,933
sure.

245
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,893
Never seen sharks feed up close before.

246
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,022
Try not to splash too much.
It attracts 'em.

247
00:20:57,106 --> 00:21:00,359
You both are so funny.

248
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,246
Look who it is... Murdock.

249
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,082
Sergeant... how's your mom?

250
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:18,085
Smells like a stogie. Otherwise, um...

251
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,922
Yeah, I keep telling Foggy
not to get her cigars, but...

252
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:25,384
She'd sneak 'em one way or the other.
Crafty old bird.

253
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,552
Right, it's why I'm here.

254
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:29,471
Friend of hers
has a case we're looking into.

255
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,515
You going after Tully?

256
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,642
Yeah, you know him?

257
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,645
Yeah. Yeah, guy's a real scumbag.

258
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,773
But he stays just this side of ordinance,
so there's nothing we can do.

259
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:40,357
Can you pull some copies
of the complaints?

260
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,276
Maybe get me a minute or two
with the officers who took them?

261
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,778
You really think you and Foggy can help?

262
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:45,279
Yeah, we can try.

263
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:47,865
Let me see what I can find.

264
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:49,283
Thank you.

265
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,301
Now, I just want you
to tell me again how did it start.

266
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,388
We have you at the scene
with a dead Chinese illegal, Piotr.

267
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:12,765
And a backpack full of drugs.

268
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:16,977
Uh-oh, that'll buy you a one-way ticket
to 30 years in Asshole Land.

269
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,313
It'll give you some time
to touch up on those tattoos.

270
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:20,773
You boys do that to yourselves

271
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,942
or do you all get shirtless
and poke each other?

272
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,735
Do you know who I work for?

273
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,446
Couple of dipshit brothers
nobody gives a wank about.

274
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,784
Bye-bye, dickhead. Enjoy your next 30.

275
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,203
Wait.

276
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,792
What if I give you another name?

277
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,169
give you another name?

278
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:43,628
He'd have to be big.

279
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:45,547
He'd have to be King freakin' Kong.

280
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:49,844
He is.

281
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:52,471
His name...

282
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,559
is Wilson Fisk.

283
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,936
Wilson Fisk.

284
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:12,491
- Well, what else you know about this guy?
- Not much.

285
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,912
No one even supposed to say his name.

286
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:20,249
But I will tell you everything I know...
for deal.

287
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,002
"For deal."

288
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:34,096
- Whose turn is it?
- Yours.

289
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,724
I thought I took it
for that thing in the bodega?

290
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:38,934
Oh, shit, yeah.

291
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:41,979
All right, wait, wait.

292
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,440
Okay, go on.

293
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,067
Go on.

294
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,237
Watch out! Jeez, he's going for my gun!

295
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,530
Watch out!

296
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:54,574
He's got my gun!

297
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:56,786
You really shouldn't have said his name.

298
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:10,883
We got shots fired...

299
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,057
God!

300
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:23,478
Feels like a place in a movie
where you'd buy a clone...

301
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,397
or maybe a robot baby.

302
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:28,564
Or the clone of a robot baby.

303
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:33,447
I'm Foggy Nelson. I called earlier.
I represent Ms. Cardenas.

304
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,157
Foggy Bear!

305
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,076
Look at you, still playing lawyer.

306
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,493
What are you doing here?

307
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,871
Working on making partner.
Marci Stahl.

308
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:42,873
Uh, Karen Page.

309
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:44,597
Wait, you work here, at Landman and Zack?

310
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:47,127
Mmm, came on right after
you and Murdock crashed and burned.

311
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:48,772
- We didn't...
- Where is your sidekick?

312
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:50,639
Didn't break it off with him already,
did you?

313
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,425
- Fog has commitment issues.
- I don't have...

314
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:55,719
Matt is taking care of something.

315
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:57,721
It was very nice to see you.
We have an appointment.

316
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:59,723
I know. It's with me.

317
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:03,102
You're Armand Tully's lawyer?

318
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:06,646
Just part of the team.
They're all tied up with real work, so...

319
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,983
All right, let's go upstairs and...

320
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:11,861
Oh, we'd be finished
before the elevator stopped.

321
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,614
Your client can agree to a buyout
or live in squalor till she's evicted.

322
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:20,160
Those workmen acted illegally.
They busted the place up.

323
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:22,412
They were making requested repairs.

324
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:23,998
- Which they never finished.
- Yeah.

325
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,333
- And did Mrs. Carnitas tell you...
- Cardenas.

326
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:31,838
Did she tell you why the workmen
left before completing the repairs?

327
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:34,884
- No, she just said...
- They feared for their safety.

328
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,844
- From an old woman?
- From a criminal element.

329
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:41,306
Her building is filled
with junkies and drug dealers.

330
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,934
We're doing the city a favor
by trying to renovate.

331
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,060
You know that's not true.

332
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,938
Yeah, because the law's
always about the truth.

333
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:51,108
Look, you know how this goes.

334
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:53,027
It's her word versus my client's,

335
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,238
and there's a whole backlog of these cases
pending throughout the city.

336
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,573
No one is going to help her but us.

337
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,702
If I were you,
I'd go to Mrs. Whatever today

338
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,789
and strongly urge her to accept our offer.

339
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:08,542
Marci.

340
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:14,548
Convincing my client
to agree to your terms... that's your job.

341
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:15,799
And I'm not going to do it for you.

342
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:17,676
See, you think there are only two options.

343
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,971
These tenants take the payout and leave,
or leave without taking it.

344
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:23,307
But given how long
they've put up with Tully's bullshit,

345
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,267
I think you're actually afraid

346
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,854
that Mrs. Cardenas and her neighbors
will find a way to eke by.

347
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:32,024
And short of physically

348
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:34,901
and very illegally forcing tenants
from their rent-controlled homes...

349
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:37,029
Armand Tully loses his condos.

350
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,323
Your firm loses Tully.

351
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:41,783
And that's very bad for business.

352
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,744
You want me and my client to think
that you're doing us a favor,

353
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:45,955
that we have no leverage.

354
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,914
When really, we have all of it.

355
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,960
So you're gonna see us in court...

356
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,795
where I will absolutely dismantle you,

357
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:57,424
from the top of your salon blowout
to the bottom of your overpriced pumps.

358
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,638
You would've killed it here, Foggy Bear.

359
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,725
You never should have left.

360
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:09,811
You never should have signed on, Marce.

361
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,647
You were really something,
back in the day.

362
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,108
When you had a soul.

363
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,611
Foggy Bear?

364
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:19,404
We used to date.

365
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:20,655
You dated that?

366
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,200
- Yep, let's step a little faster.
- Oh, my God.

367
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:31,583
They're taking statements
from Blake and Hoffman.

368
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:35,004
Our contacts in IAB will make it go away.

369
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,757
Had there been someone else in that room
with that Russian...

370
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,135
There wasn't.

371
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:42,511
It was our people.

372
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,887
This time.

373
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:49,018
Soon Vladimir won't have any comrades
to whisper your name to.

374
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,273
Is there anything else?

375
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:58,485
The '75 Brunello di Montalcino.

376
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:02,156
It's a personal favorite.

377
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:05,075
Thank you, Wesley.

378
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,271
Jesus.

379
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:43,697
Señor Tully...

380
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,241
fix?

381
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,286
No, not yet.

382
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:53,332
But Karen and I,
we're going to do what we can.

383
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:54,624
We are?

384
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:56,960
Why not?

385
00:28:57,044 --> 00:29:00,464
My dad owned a hardware store
for 12 forevers, picked up a few things.

386
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:01,747
At least get the ball rolling.

387
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:04,426
- And your cousin's a drywall guy, right?
- That he is.

388
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,512
And Matt and I fished an electrician
out of the drunk tank.

389
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:09,098
Owes us a favor.

390
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,391
We're gonna talk to your neighbors, too,
okay, Mrs. Cardenas?

391
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:12,976
We're gonna take care of you.

392
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:34,414
Ahhh!

393
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,003
Scream and that arm
becomes your good one.

394
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:41,380
We clear?

395
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,299
You killed that Russian in interrogation.

396
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,863
I had no choice,
he jumped my partner.

397
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:48,887
You lie to me and I hurt you.

398
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,806
You killed him 'cause he said a name,
Wilson Fisk.

399
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,891
I don't know what you're talking about.

400
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:55,685
Okay, okay!

401
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,815
I shot him 'cause he said a name, so what?

402
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,580
What I hear,
you like to kill Russians too.

403
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,653
You chopped Anatoly's head off.

404
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,863
And now I want his brother.

405
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:09,073
I don't know where he is!

406
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:14,454
I swear! I swear! I swear! Please. Please.

407
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,939
How are Fisk and the Russians connected?

408
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,423
Why did he kill Prohaszka for them?

409
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,008
Why?

410
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,843
You don't know?

411
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,137
Oh, man.

412
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,390
You really are one stupid son of a bitch,
aren't you?

413
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:49,573
- Good evening, madam.
- Hello.

414
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,283
This way, please.

415
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,714
I didn't know if you would show.

416
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,299
Neither did I.

417
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,278
I thought you didn't go in
for grand gestures.

418
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,928
No, it isn't...

419
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,139
I didn't want to be interrupted again.

420
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:17,642
We can go somewhere else if you like.

421
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:20,187
And if I just want
to walk out that door by myself?

422
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,022
Then I would dine alone.

423
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:25,567
It wouldn't be the first time.

424
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:30,197
I've been lied to before... by men.

425
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:34,993
Some were even decent ones...

426
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:38,162
but they still felt the need
to be dishonest...

427
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,375
about things that mattered.

428
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,548
Do you feel that need... Wilson?

429
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:53,845
I don't like to be in public.

430
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:58,642
And I don't like to be questioned.

431
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:03,730
But you can ask me anything, Vanessa.

432
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:07,401
And I will always be honest with you.

433
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:12,406
Let's start with something simple.

434
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,619
What are we drinking?

435
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:26,127
Marcel...

436
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,965
the '75 Brunello di Montalcino.

437
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:57,659
Hey, sorry about your...

438
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:02,997
Just... sorry, you know?

439
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:06,876
Sergei tells me you know something.

440
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:11,130
Something about the man
who took my brother from me.

441
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:13,425
Yeah, uh...

442
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,974
Look, I know this guy,
we did a stretch in Rikers.

443
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:24,853
Getting by now at a chop shop
on the edge of the Kitchen.

444
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,439
Told me an SUV came in yesterday.

445
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,233
Black... expensive...

446
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:33,778
backseat all splattered with blood and...

447
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:38,825
brains.

448
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,544
This car...
who does it belong to?

449
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:53,172
Some big white guy...

450
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:54,424
bald as shit.

451
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:58,762
- Fisk?
- Didn't get a name, but...

452
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:00,722
my boy said

453
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,434
he heard baldy say something
about that guy in the black mask.

454
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,396
Couldn't make it all out...

455
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,358
but sounds like
he and this mask dude are tight.

456
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,735
He works for Fisk.

457
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,822
All this time,
Fisk has been playing us...

458
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:20,784
planning this.

459
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:26,247
Tell the men to pull back and get ready.

460
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,793
Guns, rifles, grenades. All of it.

461
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:30,877
All?

462
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:37,801
Turk, spread the word on the streets...

463
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:41,930
1 million for whoever can tell me
where I can find Fisk...

464
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,181
tonight.

465
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:44,599
1 mil?

466
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:48,895
Shit... I'm on it!

467
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,702
We will honor you, my brother...

468
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:08,582
with the blood of war.

469
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:12,794
Okay, try it now.

470
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:19,884
Okay, yeah!

471
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:21,636
I admit it. I'm impressed.

472
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:25,348
Hot still doesn't work,
but at least it's a start.

473
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:31,730
You, Señor Foggy, you...

474
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:33,523
You stay, we eat.

475
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:35,525
- No, Mrs. Cardenas...
- You stay.

476
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:37,694
There is no "no happen," okay?

477
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,323
- You want to eat?
- Be rude not to.

478
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:46,035
Mi madre make this,
all the time in Guatemala.

479
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:50,790
Now I make para ustedes, como gracias.

480
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:54,377
Mrs. Cardenas, where did you make this?
You don't have any gas.

481
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:57,255
I cook in apartamento downstairs.

482
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:01,092
Aquí, we take care for another.

483
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:13,187
Did she just...

484
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,524
Did she... Is this a date?

485
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,733
Uh...

486
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:21,613
I sort of think it is, Señor Foggy.

487
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:30,955
There're no numbers in this...
no contacts.

488
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,708
It's a burner.
Like the one I use to talk to you.

489
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,396
It was buzzing.
Did someone leave a message?

490
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:37,671
Um...

491
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:39,380
No, a text.

492
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,257
What's it say?

493
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,760
It's a list of locations.

494
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,094
Four of them.

495
00:36:45,178 --> 00:36:48,389
47th and 12th. 48th and 9th.

496
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,060
42nd and 10th. 44th and 11th.

497
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,228
- 44th and 11th?
- Yeah.

498
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:57,356
Troika Restaurant.

499
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,762
Where they were holding that boy?

500
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:01,194
These addresses,
they're listing where the Russians are.

501
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,238
- The hell did you get this?
- Cop.

502
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,201
- I said go to the police, I didn't mean...
- Nah, he was working for Fisk.

503
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,911
Killed a Russian for him,
right inside the precinct.

504
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,746
Then later he gets that list of addresses.

505
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,207
I'm betting I'll find Vladimir
at one of them.

506
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,292
Matt, wait, just...

507
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,212
What are you going to do?

508
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,255
Whatever it takes.

509
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,633
You know how that sounds, right?

510
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:31,224
Um, when we were on that roof
you told that Russian...

511
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:34,686
that you hurt people because you enjoy it.

512
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,813
And you said you didn't believe that.

513
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,898
I can't believe that.

514
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:42,068
Because if I do,
that means you're not the man...

515
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,277
that I believe you to be.

516
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,071
I need to be the man this city needs.

517
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:46,906
Hey, that's not a reason, it's an excuse.

518
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,617
What do you want me to do, Claire?

519
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,284
Let them tear Hell's Kitchen apart?

520
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:53,246
Let them win?

521
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,417
What you do is important...
to so many people. I get that.

522
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:06,300
I just don't think I can let myself
fall in love with someone...

523
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:10,889
who's so damn close
to becoming what he hates.

524
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:13,892
You're right...

525
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:18,521
you shouldn't.

526
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:33,787
A prince?

527
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,705
I didn't know he was one at first.

528
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:40,043
He saw me at an exhibition.
I was the curator and traveling with it...

529
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:42,170
and all of a sudden...

530
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,675
this tall man in a white suit
and an ascot...

531
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,592
An ascot? That's a bit much.

532
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:49,969
That's what I was thinking.

533
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:54,724
He sidles up to me...
I love that word, "sidle."

534
00:38:56,392 --> 00:39:00,772
and he says, "You are more beautiful
than any painting here."

535
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,734
I knew it was a line, but it worked.

536
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:06,194
I slept with him.

537
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,951
Does that shock you?

538
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:21,500
You're a very attractive woman.
I assumed you've had lovers.

539
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:22,794
That's not what I asked.

540
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:24,295
No, it didn't shock me.

541
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:26,715
Then why'd you look away?

542
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:30,885
Because I wish I had said something
like that to you when we first met.

543
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,223
I'm glad you didn't.

544
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,984
This wine's even better than the last one.

545
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,651
Did you pick it?

546
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:52,073
I've never had it. My assistant.

547
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:57,411
I said I'd be honest.

548
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,747
You did.

549
00:39:59,956 --> 00:40:02,291
Wesley's more than an assistant...

550
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,544
he's my friend.

551
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:06,838
So you do have those.

552
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:13,052
Yet the man says he was lonely
when he looked at my painting.

553
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:14,595
My painting.

554
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:19,851
Yes.

555
00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:22,561
Thank you.

556
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:27,901
So why does a man like you feel alone?

557
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,611
Nature of my business, I suppose.

558
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:34,407
And what kind of business is that?

559
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:39,829
Rebuilding this city.

560
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,208
I want to carve something beautiful
out of its ugliness...

561
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,002
set free its potential.

562
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:48,046
You sound like an artist.

563
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,339
I'm just a man with a dream.

564
00:40:50,423 --> 00:40:52,716
What do you think an artist is?

565
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:56,262
Are those the only ones you have?

566
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,015
You were wearing them last time.

567
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:02,310
They were my father's.

568
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:06,272
I wear them every day to remember him.

569
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:09,483
Did he pass?

570
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,319
When I was a boy.

571
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,990
May I ask you something now?

572
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:18,993
I'd say you've earned it.

573
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:23,790
What kind of gun is that
you have in your purse?

574
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:34,008
It's a .22.

575
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,261
Did you think you would need that tonight?

576
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:41,349
We've been sitting here talking
for hours...

577
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:47,521
and you're going to insult me
like I have no idea what you really do?

578
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,900
What I said...

579
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,570
about what I want for this city
is the truth.

580
00:41:56,823 --> 00:42:01,911
But money and influence is not enough
to usher change on such a scale.

581
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:03,412
Sometimes it requires force.

582
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:07,583
I know you're a dangerous man.

583
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:12,839
That's why I brought a gun
to a dinner date.

584
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:15,967
Would you like to leave?

585
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,093
No...

586
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:20,179
I'd like a reason to stay.

587
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:32,942
I've done things
that I'm not proud of, Vanessa.

588
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:38,948
I've hurt people...
and I'm going to hurt more.

589
00:42:41,742 --> 00:42:44,996
It's impossible to avoid
for what I'm trying to do.

590
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,374
But I take no pleasure in it...

591
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,294
in cruelty.

592
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:55,256
But this city isn't a caterpillar.

593
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,426
It doesn't spin a cocoon
and wake up a butterfly.

594
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:04,140
A city... crumbles and fades.

595
00:43:06,976 --> 00:43:10,188
It needs to die before it can be reborn.

596
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,152
So I don't need the gun?

597
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,157
No, by my side...

598
00:43:22,658 --> 00:43:25,119
is the safest place
that you could ever be.

599
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:10,123
Vladimir...

600
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:12,833
Turk just got a call.
We know where Fisk is.

601
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:14,937
Tell the men...

602
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:17,296
and no one touches Fisk.

603
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,381
He is mine.

604
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:23,677
and Matt bangs his cane around
and says,

605
00:44:24,637 --> 00:44:26,805
"Am I in the right room?"

606
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:29,392
- Where did you put his furniture?
- Dorm room across the hall.

607
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:31,185
Oh, God!

608
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,396
Oh, I really wish
I knew you guys back then.

609
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:35,148
Much better off knowing us now.

610
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:37,025
We have our own practice.

611
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:40,153
I'm a hell of a lot more dashing
than I was in my awkward college days.

612
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:43,864
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to need
photographic proof of that, counselor.

613
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,827
I have dug myself another hole, haven't I?

614
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:50,996
Well, it's been about five minutes.
You were due.

615
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,998
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.

616
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,502
You know, there's something I gotta know.
It's killing me.

617
00:44:56,585 --> 00:45:00,714
No, I do not kiss on the first date.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

618
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,133
No! No.

619
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:08,013
What's the deal with the meat grinder
in the pencil skirt?

620
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:10,183
No, she just...
She doesn't seem like your type.

621
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:11,725
- Marci?
- Yeah.

622
00:45:13,602 --> 00:45:16,021
She was different back when I knew her.

623
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,400
Or maybe she wasn't, I don't know.

624
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,652
Matt's always getting involved
with the wrong girl,

625
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:24,155
so maybe he just rubbed off on me.

626
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:25,281
Huh.

627
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,117
Matt dates a lot?

628
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:29,243
Date?

629
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:31,412
I wouldn't exactly call it that.

630
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,810
He hasn't really been with anyone
for more than a month or two.

631
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,334
Hmm.

632
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:38,961
It's kind of sad.

633
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:42,798
On the plus side,
he gets to touch a lot of pretty girls...

634
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:44,467
on their faces.

635
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,096
Um, that's, you know,
how he tells what people look like.

636
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,556
Or at least that's
what he tells the ladies.

637
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,016
Although, he always seems
to know which ones are hot

638
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:55,603
before he puts his
grubby little mitts on them.

639
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,022
It's a real gift.
He's like a sexual Rain Man.

640
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,818
Does he know what you look like?

641
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,696
He's got a rough idea.

642
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,117
I only ever let him
put his hands on my face once,

643
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,909
'cause... weird.

644
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:14,413
Are you gonna finish that?

645
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:15,664
No, no.

646
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,087
You ever tell him what I look like?

647
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:25,048
No, he doesn't need me to tell him...

648
00:46:28,677 --> 00:46:32,097
He's probably got
a picture of you in his head.

649
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:34,517
- I don't like to mess with those.
- Oh...

650
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:39,021
Hey, Foggy...

651
00:46:42,858 --> 00:46:44,985
I want you to touch my face.

652
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:49,740
Um... but I can see you, so...

653
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:52,368
No, I... No, I know. I just, um...

654
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:58,541
I want to know how someone
who's blind would see me.

655
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:04,297
Look, you do me then, then I'll do you.

656
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:07,966
Yeah, okay.

657
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:23,065
Delivery. Gao.

658
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:09,588
The men are ready at the other locations?

659
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:10,863
They're waiting for the call.

660
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,450
Make it.

661
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,418
We expecting another delivery from Gao?

662
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:45,606
You have to close your eyes.

663
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,857
Right.

664
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:54,239
Just tell me what you feel.

665
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:02,790
Jesus, are you okay?

666
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:07,961
Foggy...

667
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:16,757
We have to stop the bleeding.

668
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,807
What is happening?

669
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:24,687
- Stay with her.
- Yeah.

670
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

671
00:49:28,524 --> 00:49:30,025
See if anyone else needs help.
I'll be right back.

672
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:31,360
Foggy...

673
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,336
Oh, my God...

674
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:52,423
Wilson?

675
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:56,969
Did you read about the boy...

676
00:49:57,052 --> 00:50:00,473
who watched his father
being pulled from their car and beaten,

677
00:50:00,556 --> 00:50:02,015
before the boy was taken?

678
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,729
The men that did that...

679
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:10,649
they will no longer infect this city.

680
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,451
Good.

681
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,334
We should call it a night.

682
00:50:29,418 --> 00:50:31,462
I need to get you home
before the roads close.

683
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:32,671
Marcel?

684
00:50:35,215 --> 00:50:36,717
Your car is ready, sir.

685
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,469
Yes, just one more thing...

686
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:46,394
I want to give you this.

687
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,802
Thank you for everything
you've done for me this evening.

688
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:52,775
For making this call for me, especially.

689
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:54,527
A pleasure as always, sir.

690
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:45,744
Vladimir!

691
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:48,622
Vladimir!

692
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,167
Vladimir!

693
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,651
We must go! Quickly.

694
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:04,680
Never liked
those borscht eatin' bastards.

695
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:07,224
Paid shit for shit work.

696
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,021
Although, Vlady did offer a cool mil
to give up your boy.

697
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:19,695
You're alive...
which means you made the right decision.

698
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:25,826
Your conversation with Vladimir
caused him to react predictably.

699
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,453
My employer is grateful for that.

700
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:31,874
Hey, happy to help.

701
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:36,003
But why all that with plantin' the mask?

702
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:40,257
Why not just blow 'em up from the start,
if that's what you were gonna do?

703
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,552
It takes time
to arrange something like this,

704
00:52:43,636 --> 00:52:45,470
and help from friends.

705
00:52:46,972 --> 00:52:50,643
We needed to keep Vladimir off balance
until everything was in place.

706
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,187
Right.

707
00:52:55,147 --> 00:52:57,900
Got mad respect for a smart move.

708
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:02,112
You need anything else,
you know where to find me.

709
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:03,280
Hmm.

710
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17,335
You are hurt.

711
00:53:17,419 --> 00:53:18,546
I will live.

712
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:23,508
And see Fisk and his masked dog
pay for what they did.

713
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:47,049
This one's for Claire.

714
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,079
Hands in the air!

715
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,872
Raise those hands!

716
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:54,998
Don't move! Raise 'em!

717
00:53:55,082 --> 00:53:56,499
Hands in the air, now!

718
00:54:00,128 --> 00:54:02,631
Check the two on the ground.
Suspect is in custody.

719
00:54:02,715 --> 00:54:04,382
On the ground now,
you son of a bitch.

720
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,641
